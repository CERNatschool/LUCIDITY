LUCIDITY========Introduction------------The **L**angton **U**ltimate **C**osmic ray **I**netensity **D**etector**I**nteractive **T**est s **Y** stem is a web app for running and managing simulations of the LUCID detector.It is based on the [Hobo](http://www.hobocentral.net/) Ruby on Rails framework,and was used in the research reported in:* [T. Whyntie and M. A. Harrison, J. Phys.: Conf. Ser. 513 022038](http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/513/2/022038)i.e. the proceedings from the corresponding conference presentationat the_20th International Conference on Computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics_,a.k.a.[CHEP 2013](https://indico.cern.ch/event/214784/contributions/1512648/).### Disclaimers* _This code dates from 2013. While every attempt has beenmade to ensure that it is usable, some work may be required to get itrunning on your own particular system.  Unfortunately CERN@school cannotguarantee support for this.  Please proceed at your own risk_.* _This repository is now deprecated, and remains here for legacy purposes.For future work regarding LUCID and CERN@school, please refer to the[Institute for Research in Schools](http://researchinschools.org) (IRIS)[GitHub repository](https://github.com/InstituteForResearchInSchools).Please also feel free to fork and modify this code as required foryour own research._### AcknowledgementsCERN@school was supported bythe UK [Science and Technology Facilities Council](http://www.stfc.ac.uk) (STFC)via grant numbers ST/J000256/1 and ST/N00101X/1,as well as a Special Award from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851.The CERN@school Collaboration would also like to acknowledge the supportprovided by the [GridPP Collaboration](http://www.gridpp.ac.uk)in terms of both computing resources and technical guidance fromcollaboration members.### Getting the code from GitHubTo clone the `LUCIDITY` repository to your system open a terminalshell and type the following commands.```bashcd $WORKINGDIR # environment variable for your working directory,               # i.e. change directory to your working directory.git clone https://github.com/CERNatschool/LUCIDITYcd LUCIDITY```Advanced users may wish to *fork* the `LUCIDITY` repo so thatyou can play with the code and commit your own changes to your GitHubaccount.
